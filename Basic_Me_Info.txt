Who am I ?

My name is Guillermo and I have many interests or hobbies as we like to call them. 
I have a heavy belief that life is meant to be enjoyed to the fullest. Here are quotes that 
resonate with me. 
"A Jack-of-all trades but a master of none. Still better than a master of one."
	-I dont know who 

"Life is an opportunity to create meaning"
	-Osho

What is this for?

Well to be honest this was made because this is my way of expressing my artistic talent...and because I just had
an Irish Coffee. But this webpage is essentially a love letter to technology. 

Why?

I started my love affair with technology at quite a late age. Unlike the many nerds that had ataris, Comodores or the tyical narrativr
one hears of the various geeks. I broke my first HP computer. How? Well I don't rememer what I did, I just know the condition;
unlimeted restarts. 

I got my first laptop and after installing drivers that overclocked my GPU so I could run Crysis in higher settings, I experienced another
crash. The process of going through HP support was painstacking. They deleted all my data!

So I told myself that I would learn. I googled every problem I ever had and eventually started to become better at troubleshooting. 
But my hunger for knowledge grew...

When?

Well I was 17 and in love with tech, I wanted to learn everything, but did not have the means, so classes it was. 
I taught myself to troubleshoot common computer problems. I tauhgt myslef how to build computers, and I started my own side business
of fixing computers for my community. 

Where?

This was is the valley of Sacramento, a small city town called Woodland. This was before Silicon Valley became established as the 
Mecca of tech, the middle wave of its inception circa 2007.
